Commoners use this level but it means Citizen / Merchant / Farmer and they use it only in formal settings. Nobles and Royals have Castles and Commoners living in a Castle use the Commoner character then that Noble's TITLE but it means Servant.

Those not direct descendants of the ruler are stripped of their current SCOPE and become Estate Nobles. The new Ruler chooses the level below and may raise non descendants to that SCOPE even if they are commoners. The same occurs if one of his directs dies with no heirs.  This then occurs for each level in succession down to Borough Noble. They may pick new Estate Heads but cannot remove an Estate Noble. Estates and below are otherwise unaffected.
